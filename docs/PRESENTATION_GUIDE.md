## 🎤 Presentation Delivery Tips

### Opening (First 2 minutes)
1. Start with the problem (everyone feels the pain)
2. Share a shocking stat ("$1M lost per month")
3. Preview the solution in one sentence
4. Set expectations for the call

**Example**:
> "Today, I'm going to show you how we helped customers recover $12M in declined payment revenue. We'll cover three AI-powered engines, show you live results, and discuss next steps. I've reserved 15 minutes for presentation and 5 for your questions. Sound good?"

### Demo (Middle section)
1. Show, don't just tell (live notebooks > slides)
2. Pause for questions every 5 minutes
3. Use real numbers from their industry
4. Highlight "wow moments" (e.g., 92% model accuracy)

### Closing (Last 3 minutes)
1. Summarize the three key benefits
2. Restate the ROI (14,900%)
3. Propose clear next steps
4. Ask for commitment (not just "let's stay in touch")

**Example**:
> "So we've seen how this delivers $12M in annual value with a 14,900% ROI. The next step is a free 2-week POC on your historical data. Can we get that scheduled for next week?"

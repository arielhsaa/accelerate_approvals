# Payment Approval Acceleration - Executive Summary
## Azure Databricks Solution

## The Opportunity

**15-30% of payment transactions decline at checkout**, costing businesses billions in lost revenue and customer frustration. Current decisioning systems are fragmented, reactive, and lack intelligence.

## Our Solution

**AI-powered payment optimization platform** built on Azure Databricks that maximizes approval rates while maintaining security through three intelligent engines:

### 1. 🎯 Smart Checkout
Dynamic selection of optimal payment solutions (3DS, Network Token, IDPay, etc.) based on real-time ML predictions.

**Result**: **15-25% approval rate increase**

### 2. 🔍 Reason Code Intelligence  
Automated decline analysis that translates cryptic reason codes into actionable insights for operations teams.

**Result**: **40% reduction in preventable declines**

### 3. 🔄 Smart Retry
